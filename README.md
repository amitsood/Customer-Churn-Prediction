# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a comprehensive strategy for building,
managing and strengthening loyal and long-lasting customer relationships. It is broadly
acknowledged and extensively applied to different fields, for example, telecommunications,
banking and insurance, retail market, etc.

In any business strategy, one of its main objectives is customer retention. For example,
Vodafone should asses the customers’ activities (from their call logs) and hence predict the
customers’ churn rate, so that a measure (a special incentive to customers) can be taken to
retain them accordingly. The importance of this objective is obvious, given the fact that the
cost for customer acquisition is much greater than the cost of customer retention (in some
cases it is 20 times more expensive).

Thus, tools to develop and apply customer retention models (churn models) are required and
are essential Business Analytics applications. In the dynamic market environment, churning
could be the result of low-level customer satisfaction, aggressive competitive strategies, new
products, regulations, etc. Churn models aim to identify early churn signals and recognize
customers with an increased likelihood to leave voluntarily.
